# Default stopword list (always loaded)
# a configured language specific stopword list is appended (like: yacy.stopwords.de)
#     (depending on the language of the yacy user interface)
# Stopwords are excluded from search queries and excluded from the topword (navigation, in addition to yacy.badwords)
#
# if list exists in DATA/SETTINGS/ it takes preference otherwise list is loaded from defaults/ directory
